# Virtual Basketball

It's basketball on Friday's... but virtual. Social distancing yay.

## Setup

- Clone the repository
- cd into the directory
- Run `npm install`
	-make sure node is in PATH (if its not, run set PATH=<nodejs location>;%PATH%)
- If you get an ENOENT error just keep running it :)
- Run `node app.js` or `npm start` (use while developing to auto refresh the server after edits)

## Deploy Instructions
